# Open Gea and YvY - Background

YvY means earth or soil in Guarani (is a South American language spoken by communities in neighboring countries),and Gea is the ancient Greek goddess of the earth, mother of the Titans. We choose it to honor that resource essential for the life of the planet and so important in the lives of millions of men and women around the world.

YvY was the seed and the original name of the solution we are presenting here. And Open Gea is the open source transformation of YvY.


The Plan21 Foundation's Regenerative Agriculture Program was born to contribute to the transformation of the agricultural sector in Latin America. YvY (the original name) has a web application to support small farmers. The YvY prototype was a regional finalist for Latin America in the Call for Code 2021 and is part of the first group of projects in the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, together with Heifer International and The Nature Conservancy.

This project seeks to respond to the current problems faced by small farmers in Latin America such as: Climate change, loss of soil fertility, misuse of agrochemicals and new market demands and regulations.

Through a web application that uses IBM Intelligence Suite technology and other technologies, to provide information that allows for more sustainable decision-making and that facilitates and improves the management of agricultural production, towards regenerative processes.
Currently this project has more than 10 functionalities that have been provided to several groups of farmers in Latin America for free.


## Origins in Call for Code 

In 2021, the YvY project (Open Gea is the open source version) was a regional finalist for IBM Call For Code, a program that invites software developers and innovators around the world to combat climate change with technology, in which it provides support for project development to each selected organization. Plan21 along with Heifer International and The Nature Conservancy was part of the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, a program that applies IBM technologies, helping populations especially vulnerable to environmental threats, including climate change, extreme weather and pollution.


## The process:

This project was created with an inclusive view, opening up different actors in the agricultural sector for its conceptualization and the design of the tools. Institutions such as the Technological Institute of Costa Rica within the programming area, the Ministry of Agriculture, have participated in this process. of Costa Rica, private sector companies such as Smart Planet and of course as a fundamental axis the perceptions of small farmers who contributed their knowledge to the design of a large part of the functionalities were taken into account.


## Initial Partners

IBM, the technological TEC of Costa Rica, MAG Ministry of Agriculture of Costa Rica and Smart Planet Certification Company were the most important allies in the initial stages of the project.


## YvY Growing Ecosystem

Currently, the network of YvY allies continues to expand since it is an initiative that seeks continuous improvement and has a comprehensive view of the solutions it offers, for this reason it is a project that allows the participation of different actors in the construction of the tool. It involves different areas of knowledge both in the computer science area and in environmental sciences and the perspective of those who use this application.

## Present of YvY

YvY is currently being tested by more than 5 Latin American countries; Costa Rica, Ecuador, Argentina, Guatemala and Colombia.
YvY functionalities are currently
Climate forecasts
Agronomic data
Water and carbon footprint calculation
Comparative seasonal forecasts with historical records.
Historical record
Irrigation Needs
Soil regeneration plan
Sustainability self-diagnosis
Generation of custom QR codes

## Join the community

This Open Gea seeks to create a comprehensive and 100% useful tool for the productive, social and environmental reality of the beneficiaries. For this reason, it is of utmost importance to participate and create a community of professionals who contribute their knowledge and skills to this purpose. We face a changing reality where small farmers face new challenges every day, and sustainable food production is imminent. In this context, technology plays a fundamental role in supporting processes of change and facing new realities.
