# Open YvY background

YvY means earth or soil in Guarani, that is why we chose that name, to honor that resource essential for the life of the planet and so important in the lives of millions of men and women around the world.

The Plan21 Foundation's Regenerative Agriculture Program was born to contribute to the transformation of the agricultural sector in Latin America. YvY has a web application to support small farmers. The YvY prototype was a regional finalist for Latin America in the Call for Code 2021 and is part of the first group of projects in the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, together with Heifer International and The Nature Conservancy.

This project seeks to respond to the current problems faced by small farmers in Latin America such as: Climate change, loss of soil fertility, misuse of agrochemicals and new market demands and regulations.

Through a web application that uses IBM Intelligence Suite technology and other technologies, to provide information that allows for more sustainable decision-making and that facilitates and improves the management of agricultural production, towards regenerative processes.
Currently this project has more than 10 functionalities that have been provided to several groups of farmers in Latin America for free.
